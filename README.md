In this project, the first step was to create a website layout or design concept using Figma. Then, the website was developed using JavaScript and the ReactJS library. To enhance the website's functionality, various React libraries were used, and Tailwind CSS was incorporated to make it responsive, i.e., to ensure that it could adjust to different screen sizes on different devices. Finally, the website was deployed on GitHub Pages, which is a popular hosting service, to ensure that it could be accessed by users seamlessly and reliably.
